# Firewall-Network-Config-Mindmaps

Generate Mindmaps from (PIX/ASA) Firewall and Network Configs.

Bunch of perl scripts to take config files as inputs and generate mindmaps to better understand access controls (ACLs) and object relationships.

These are pretty old files; objective to publish is to enhance and update.
